# usb-passthrough

This section made possible by [this repo](https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX#usbfluxd-iphone-usb---network-style-passthrough-osx-kvm-docker-osx).

These scripts are used to easily enable USB-over-network passthrough for my macOS VM instances.

Instructions: Run the start scripts in order: `start1`, `start2`, `start3`. Let them run (if they want to) until you are finished with the VM.

To get this working, I always need to run these scripts *before* starting the VM. Sometimes, it doesn't work the first time and a VM restart is required.

Good luck!
